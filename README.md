## üìÖ Day 3 Task: Data Virtualization using Amazon S3 + QuickSight (Netflix Dataset)

Today, I explored **data virtualization** by uploading the **Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset** (CSV format) to **Amazon S3** and visualizing it directly using **Amazon QuickSight**, without moving the data elsewhere.

---

## ‚úÖ What I Did

- Downloaded the Netflix dataset in CSV format from Kaggle
- Created an Amazon S3 bucket and uploaded the CSV file
- Granted QuickSight access to the S3 bucket
- Connected QuickSight to the CSV in S3 via a manifest file
- Created an interactive dashboard to explore:
  - Top genres
  - Country-wise distribution
  - Content type (Movies vs. TV Shows)
  - Year-wise content release trends
